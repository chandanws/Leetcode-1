# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Note:**  
A solution using O(_n_) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

**OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:**

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:  

<pre>   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
</pre>

The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.</div>
